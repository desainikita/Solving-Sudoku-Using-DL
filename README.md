# Solving Sudoku Using Image Detection, Digit Recognition and Deep Learning

Solving the sudoku that is printed in the daily newspaper is something that we have all grown up doing. However, the problem with this is that we cannot confirm the correctness of the solution until the next day since the solution is printed in the following day’s newspaper. From the reference links provided to us by the professor, we have chosen the topic of Solving Sudoku using Deep Learning. Multiple machine learning algorithms already exist that solve the sudoku, but development is still in progress in the field of taking sudoku image as input. For a layman, entering the sudoku in array format would be a tedious task as compared to clicking a picture of the sudoku and uploading it. We thus propose a technique where in only the sudoku image will be required as the input and the algorithm will output the solved sudoku.

We have used two deep learning models that have been trained and are being used in two different phases of our project. The main architecture of implementation follows the below depicted flow.
